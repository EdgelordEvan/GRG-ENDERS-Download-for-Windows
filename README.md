Have a nice day.

Known Bugs (Didn't have time to fix within 72 hour time limit):

1.) Boss healthbar is broken. Do not trust it. The boss takes 100 hits to kill, not three.

2.) Edges cause player to float sometimes. If this happens, go toward the edge again, then jump away from the edge. It should stop then.

3.) Triggering one GRG triggers all of them (Though this should not be much of a problem)

4.)  During pause, you can't move, but animations like run, crouch, and jump will play the first frame.

5.) Player health does not carry over from scenes

6.) Music does not carry over from scenes.


Next Game? (Maybe):
The next game I'll make is a Dating Simulator called "Eustace's Plight". It's a game where you date Eustace from Courage the Cowardly Dog.
